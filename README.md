# BSC Budget Analysis

Looking ahead through 2022, the Big Store Company (BSC) anticipates potential challenges to enterprise-wide revenues due to economic uncertainty, rising inflation, supply chain bottlenecks, and the global pandemic. Proactive measures to prepare for and alleviate short-term pressures are essential for the firm's long-term sustainability.

# Proposal

## Growth Strategies

To meet stretch forecasts of 5%, 10%, and 15%, BSC proposes the following actions:

1. Implement product growth rates of 30%, 35%, and 40% for 2022 to achieve total growth rate scenarios.
2. Focus on specific product categories, particularly electronics and movies, differentiating the store from key market competitors.
3. Satisfy customer requirements through continued research and development of product categories and enhanced inventory management using sophisticated technology.

# Analysis

## Budget and Variance

The budget for BSC is created considering the company's sales objectives and costs. Variance analysis indicates a favorable overall variance for 2017, 2018, and 2019. However, 2022's projected baseline of $12 million is significantly less than the previous year's $28 million, making short-term success imperative for long-term recovery.

## Growth Scenarios

Scenarios of 5%, 10%, and 15% growth above the baseline require increased sales across all subcategories. Focus on leveraging high demand for electronics, with a specific emphasis on video equipment, cameras, miscellaneous items, audio equipment, TVs, and computers.

## Regional Analysis

The Northeast region consistently shows the highest revenue across books, electronics, movies, and music categories, while the Northwest lags in these areas for 2019, 2020, and 2021.

## Market Trends

Electronic subcategories like videography and camera gear show promising trends, overtaking computers in recent years.

# Risks

Entering a saturated market and introducing new products entail risks, including low customer retention and potential financial losses. The decision to market new products should be carefully weighed against potential expenses and uncertain returns.

# Recommendations

1. Introduce smaller electronics lines that complement existing offerings, such as electronics for cars, camping, fitness, and home security, based on industry trends.
2. Purchase more books and movies to supplement growth goals.
3. Develop the online platform for web sales to foster consistent growth.

# Summary

Quantitative financial analysis provides an overview of the proposed business, considering economic conditions, market trends, and growth strategies. Success depends on the effective implementation of the proposed strategies and the stability or improvement of the company's economy and market.
